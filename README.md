# Diffusion-Model-Handwritten-Digit-Generation
This project implements a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) in PyTorch to generate handwritten digits. The model learns to iteratively remove noise from random Gaussian samples, ultimately producing high-quality digit images similar to the MNIST dataset.
